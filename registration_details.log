BL-473 UX: Iterate design artifacts to include class registration

    Assignee - Lauren Ruiz 
    Co-owner - Anthony Layne 

        - Iterate the Figma design artifacts for this product
        - Designs for this flow should be complete, or close to complete. 
        - We may need some registration updates to the mockups with a simplified version of existing designs, where a parent can see more about courses they are interested in.

    Assignee - Lauren Ruiz 
    Co-owner - Anthony Layne 

        - Admins should be able to add courses, so that parents can find the courses when they are searching
        - Use designs from BL-473 for this feature 
        - Update Admin component to include a button to add at the top, and a list of courses that are available
        - They would be able to add all of the necessary details that need to be shown to a parent when searching for courses
